Just a tired voice, rough hands, and a heart that's been hurting for a very long time. I'm here tonight not because I'm chasing fame, but because I lost someone I've never stopped looking for. My son, Elijah. He was eight when his mother took him and left. She moved to Portland, Oregon. Or at least, that's where I heard she went. I don't even know if they stayed there. It's been so long, I don't know where he is now. I was at work when it happened. When I got home, the house was quiet, and he was gone. I didn't have a lawyer. I didn't have anyone to fight for me. So I worked. I built roofs in the heat, dug ditches, ate alone. Every night, I'd whisper his name like a prayer. Sometimes I'd talk to his photo, asking how his day went, just to feel like I was still his dad. They say time heals, but time doesn't know what it's like to lose a child. Every birthday, every holiday, I sat in silence hoping, just hoping, he might remember me. But nothing ever came. No calls, no letters, just the sound of years passing by. I never remarried, never moved on. My heart stayed with that little boy, frozen in time. And maybe he's grown now. Maybe he's forgotten me. But I never forgot him. Not for one minute. I never stopped loving him. I never stopped being his father. That's why I'm here. To sing a song I wrote for him. Because if he's out there, if he's watching, I want him to hear this. This is for you, Elijah, from your dad."
