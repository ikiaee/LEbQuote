"Lemon Tree" is a popular song by the German band Fool's Garden, released in 1995 as part of their album *Dish of the Day*. The song became an international hit, reaching high positions on music charts across Europe and Asia. The lyrics describe a person sitting alone under a lemon tree, waiting for someone who never comes. The lemon tree symbolizes waiting and disappointment—the singer feels stuck in a passive state, much like how a lemon tree just stands there, not moving or changing.  

Key lines like:  
*"I'm sitting here in a boring room, it's just another rainy Sunday afternoon"*  
and  
*"I'm wasting my time, I got nothing to do, I'm hanging around, I'm waiting for you"*  

suggest monotony and unfulfilled expectations. The "yellow lemon tree" could also represent false hope—something bright and appealing, yet ultimately sour and unfulfilling.
