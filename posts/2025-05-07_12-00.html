Quiet minds cannot be perplexed or frightened. — Robert Louis Stevenson

<b>Poem of the Day: Enoch Arden</b>
<i>by Lord Alfred Tennyson</i>
Many a sad kiss by day and night renew'd
(Sure that all evil would come out of it)
Besought him, supplicating, if he cared
For here or his dear children, not to go.
