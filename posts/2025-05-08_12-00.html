Quiet minds cannot be perplexed or frightened. — Robert Louis Stevenson

<b>Poem of the Day: Enoch Arden</b>
<i>by Lord Alfred Tennyson</i>
She could not fix the glass to suit her eye;
Perhaps her eye was dim, hand tremulous;
She saw him not: and while he stood on deck
Waving, the moment and the vessel past.
