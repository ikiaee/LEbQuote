Don’t watch the clock; do what it does. Keep going. — Sam Levenson

<b>Poem of the Day: Enoch Arden</b>
<i>by Lord Alfred Tennyson</i>
But when the last of those last moments came,
`Annie my girl, cheer up, be comforted,
Look to the babes, and till I come again,
Keep everything shipshape, for I must go.
