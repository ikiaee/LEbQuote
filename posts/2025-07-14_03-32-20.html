    <h2>Quote of the Day</h2>
    <blockquote>"I am not bound to win, but I am bound to be true. I am not bound to <strong>succeed</strong>, but I am bound to live by the light that I have. I must stand with anybody that stands right, and stand with him while he is right, and part with him when he goes wrong." — Abraham Lincoln</blockquote>
