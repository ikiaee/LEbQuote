    <h2>Quote of the Day</h2>
    <blockquote>"Consult not your fears but your hopes and your dreams. Think not about your <strong>frustrations</strong>, but about your unfulfilled potential. Concern yourself not with what you tried and failed in, but with what it is still possible for you to do." — Pope John XXIII</blockquote>
