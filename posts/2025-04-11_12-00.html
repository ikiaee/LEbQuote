Adaptability is about the powerful difference between adapting to cope and adapting to win. — Max McKeown

<b>Poem of the Day: To Autumn</b>
<i>by John Keats</i>
Season of mists and mellow fruitfulness,
Close bosom-friend of the maturing sun;
Conspiring with him how to load and bless
With fruit the vines that round the thatch-eves run;
