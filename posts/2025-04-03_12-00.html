Glow from within or not at all. — Authenticity Rule

<b>Poem of the Day: The Lamplighter</b>
<i>by Robert Louis Stevenson</i>
My tea is nearly ready and the sun has left the sky;
It's time to take the window to see Leerie going by;
For every night at teatime and before you take your seat,
With lantern and with ladder he comes posting up the street.
