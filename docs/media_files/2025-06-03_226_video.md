Meaning of "Hallelujah"
The word "Hallelujah" itself is Hebrew (הַלְּלוּיָהּ), meaning "Praise the Lord." However, Leonard Cohen's song is not purely religious; it blends themes of love, loss, doubt, and spiritual struggle.

Cohen’s lyrics weave together biblical references (such as King David and Bathsheba, Samson and Delilah) with deeply personal and sometimes sensual imagery. The song explores the tension between sacred and secular love, the pain of broken relationships, and the search for meaning in suffering.
